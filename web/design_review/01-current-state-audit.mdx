# Current State Design Audit

**Date:** 2026-02-19

## Overview

ElectionOdds is a Next.js 16 prediction market aggregator pulling data from PredictIt, Kalshi, Polymarket, and Smarkets. The current production design uses a minimal, functional layout with standard component patterns.

## Visual Identity

| Aspect | Current State | Assessment |
|--------|--------------|------------|
| Color palette | Zinc-based neutral dark theme | Functional but undifferentiated |
| Typography | Geist Sans/Mono (Vercel default) | Clean but generic |
| Spacing | Standard Tailwind scale | Consistent |
| Icons | Lucide React | Good, comprehensive |
| Charts | Recharts line/area | Functional but plain |

## Layout Patterns

- **Navigation:** Standard header with nav links + mobile hamburger
- **Data tables:** Basic HTML tables with alternating backgrounds
- **Cards:** Simple bordered containers with padding
- **Charts:** Full-width Recharts with basic tooltips
- **Responsive:** Standard Tailwind breakpoints (md, lg)

## Strengths

1. **Data-first approach** — prices, changes, and volumes are immediately visible
2. **Multi-source transparency** — shows per-source prices (PredictIt, Kalshi, etc.)
3. **Consistent number formatting** — formatPercent() used throughout, 0-1 decimal standard
4. **Fast load times** — static generation where possible, minimal client JS
5. **Comprehensive coverage** — presidential, primaries, house, senate, governors, maps

## Weaknesses

1. **Low visual differentiation** — looks like a generic dashboard template
2. **No emotional hook** — no narrative, no urgency indicators, no social proof
3. **Weak information hierarchy** — all data presented at equal weight
4. **No progressive disclosure** — all complexity shown at once
5. **Mobile experience** — functional but not optimized for thumb-zone interactions
6. **No brand personality** — could be any data aggregator

## Key Metrics (Production)

- Pages: 15+ routes
- Components: ~30 shared components
- Data sources: 4 active (PredictIt, Kalshi, Polymarket, Smarkets)
- Markets tracked: 718
- Update frequency: Every 5 minutes via GitHub Actions

## User Personas

| Persona | Current Support | Gap |
|---------|----------------|-----|
| Political junkie | Good — lots of data | Lacks narrative/context |
| Journalist | Moderate — data available | No editorial framing |
| Sports bettor | Weak — unfamiliar layout | No matchup/comparison format |
| Data analyst | Moderate — charts exist | No statistical depth |
| Casual voter | Weak — too dense | No simplified entry point |

## Recommendations

The current design serves data-literate users well but fails to create distinct appeal for specific audiences. The 5 overhaul concepts each target a different persona with a purpose-built information architecture.
