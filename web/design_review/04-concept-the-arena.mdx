# Concept 03: The Arena

**Route:** /design-overhauls/03
**Target Persona:** Sports fans, casual bettors, competitive viewers
**Design Metaphor:** ESPN matchup page / fight card

## Core Thesis

Election odds are inherently competitive — two sides, one winner. Lean into the versus format. Display every race as a head-to-head matchup with circular gauges, spread bars, and "who's winning" indicators. Make politics feel like game day.

## Key Design Decisions

### Layout
- Featured matchup hero (full-width, detailed)
- 3-column matchup card grid
- Power rankings leaderboard (top 10 across all markets)
- Quick stats bar with key metrics

### Matchup Format
- Circular ProgressRing gauges for each side
- VS badge between fighters
- DualBar spread visualization
- "Leading" badge on the frontrunner
- Trend chart showing head-to-head movement

### Visual Language
- Gradient header (red-to-blue) for bipartisan branding
- Swords icon as primary motif
- Trophy/flame icons for rankings and featured
- Card-based layout with rounded corners (rounded-2xl)
- Party colors (blue/red) drive all data visualization

### Competitive Framing
- "Spread" shown in percentage points
- "Leading" badges highlight frontrunners
- Power Rankings table ranks all candidates globally
- Quick stats include "Leader" with name + odds

## Strengths
- Immediately engaging — VS format is universally understood
- ProgressRing gauges are visually distinctive
- DualBar shows relative position at a glance
- Works for any two-sided race (party, candidate, control)

## Weaknesses
- Forced into 1v1 format — primaries with 8 candidates only show top 2
- May trivialize complex policy differences
- Competitive framing could alienate policy-focused users
- Lots of visual chrome per matchup = lower data density

## Shared Components Used
- ProgressRing (circular probability gauge)
- DualBar (side-by-side probability bar)
- PartyColor (consistent party color mapping)

## Technical Notes
- ~340 lines
- Builds matchup data from mock market contracts
- 6 pre-built matchups covering all major races
- Uses gradient backgrounds for featured hero section
