# Concept 04: Forecast Dashboard

**Route:** /design-overhauls/04
**Target Persona:** Data analysts, poll watchers, FiveThirtyEight readers
**Design Metaphor:** FiveThirtyEight / The Economist data journalism

## Core Thesis

Sophisticated users want statistical depth — not just "who's winning" but how confident we should be, how sources agree, and what the track record looks like. This design adds analytical layers: source consensus, confidence signals, Brier scores, and control forecasts.

## Key Design Decisions

### Layout
- Full-width forecast panel (headline probability)
- Sidebar with control forecasts + confidence meter
- Two-column candidate tables
- Bottom row: source agreement + track record

### Statistical Depth
- "X in 100" probability framing (FiveThirtyEight convention)
- 50% reference line on trend charts
- Source consensus matrix (deviation from mean)
- Brier score track record with bar chart
- Confidence signals panel with quality indicators

### Information Architecture
1. **Top:** Big question + big numbers (party probability)
2. **Right sidebar:** Control forecasts (House/Senate/Presidency) + confidence
3. **Middle:** Detailed candidate-level data with party badges
4. **Bottom:** Source agreement and historical accuracy

### Visual Language
- Emerald accent for confidence/accuracy
- Party-colored strips on candidate rows
- Reference lines on charts for context
- Info icon + methodology notes for transparency
- Time range selector (7d, 30d, 90d)

## Strengths
- Deepest analytical content of all concepts
- Source consensus view is unique and valuable
- Track record builds credibility with data-savvy users
- Confidence signals acknowledge uncertainty honestly
- Control forecasts give quick overview of all races

## Weaknesses
- High complexity may overwhelm casual users
- Brier scores require explanation for non-statisticians
- Confidence signals are simulated (need real methodology)
- Dense layout requires large screens for best experience

## Shared Components Used
- ProgressRing (confidence meter)
- HorizontalBar (candidate probability bars)
- DualBar (control forecast bars)
- PartyColor (party identification + coloring)

## Technical Notes
- ~420 lines
- Uses Recharts: AreaChart, BarChart, ReferenceLine, Cell
- Track record data from mockTrackRecord
- Brier score chart with color-coded correct/incorrect calls
- Metrics bar with live-updating timestamp
