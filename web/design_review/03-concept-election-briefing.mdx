# Concept 02: The Election Briefing

**Route:** /design-overhauls/02
**Target Persona:** Journalists, editors, newsroom professionals
**Design Metaphor:** Newspaper front page / wire service

## Core Thesis

Frame prediction market data as editorial intelligence. Journalists need context, narrative, and quotable numbers. The design borrows newspaper conventions — mastheads, bylines, section tabs, columnar layouts — to make data feel like news.

## Key Design Decisions

### Layout
- Newspaper grid: 2/3 main content + 1/3 sidebar
- Masthead with serif typography (Georgia)
- Section tabs (All Stories, Presidential, Midterms, Primaries)
- Scrolling wire ticker for breaking updates

### Content Strategy
- Lead story with auto-generated narrative paragraph
- Market briefs as compact card summaries
- "By The Numbers" sidebar for quick-reference stats
- Source breakdown visualization
- Methodology note for credibility

### Narrative Elements
- Headline auto-generated from leader's name + percentage
- Body text describes trend direction and volume
- "Biggest Movers" sidebar flags notable changes
- Time-ago timestamps create urgency

### Visual Language
- Dark background with serif typography for editorial feel
- Amber accent for lead story badge and section tabs
- Wire ticker with pulse animation
- Horizontal probability bars for at-a-glance comparison
- Card-based market briefs with party-colored bars

## Strengths
- Immediately quotable — headlines write themselves
- Familiar newspaper conventions reduce cognitive load
- Section filtering enables topic-specific briefings
- Methodology note builds trust with editorial audience

## Weaknesses
- Auto-generated prose may feel formulaic
- Serif typography on dark backgrounds requires careful sizing
- Wire ticker may feel noisy for some users
- Less data density than Command Center

## Shared Components Used
- HorizontalBar (probability visualization)
- PartyColor (candidate/party color mapping)

## Technical Notes
- ~280 lines
- Section state with useState for filtering
- Uses Georgia serif font stack
- Wire ticker with CSS scroll animation
