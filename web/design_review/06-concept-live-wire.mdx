# Concept 05: Live Wire

**Route:** /design-overhauls/05
**Target Persona:** Mobile users, social media natives, casual followers
**Design Metaphor:** Twitter/X feed / news app / Instagram stories

## Core Thesis

Most people consume political content on their phones, in short bursts, through social feeds. Live Wire reimagines election odds as a card-based feed with social interactions (like, comment, share, bookmark), type-based filtering, and trending sidebar.

## Key Design Decisions

### Layout
- Sticky header with live indicator
- Filter chips (All, Alerts, Movers, Markets, Milestones)
- Single-column card feed (mobile-first)
- Sidebar with trending list + quick snapshot (desktop)
- Scroll-to-top FAB button

### Card Anatomy
- Type badge (Alert, Mover, Market, Milestone, Compare)
- Timestamp + bookmark action
- Headline + detail text
- Data strip: ProgressRing + sparkline + key metrics
- Optional market mini-table (for market/comparison types)
- Social actions: like, comment, share

### Feed Card Types
- **Alert:** Breaking or notable position (red badge)
- **Mover:** Biggest price changes (green badge)
- **Market:** Full market overview with mini-table (blue badge)
- **Milestone:** Threshold crossings (amber badge)
- **Compare:** Side-by-side market summary (purple badge)

### Visual Language
- Rounded corners throughout (rounded-2xl)
- Social-media-style interaction buttons
- Gradient header (orange-to-red)
- Pulse animation on "Live" indicator
- Filter chips with pill styling
- Scroll-to-top button appears after 400px scroll

## Strengths
- Most mobile-friendly of all concepts
- Card format is shareable and digestible
- Type filtering lets users focus on what matters
- Social actions create engagement and stickiness
- Trending sidebar surfaces important movements

## Weaknesses
- Lower data density than other concepts
- No detailed tables or comparison views
- Social actions are decorative (no backend)
- Feed order is time-based, not importance-based
- Sparklines are compact but hard to read on small screens

## Shared Components Used
- ProgressRing (inline candidate gauge)
- HorizontalBar (mini-table bars)
- PartyColor (color coding throughout)
- MiniChart pattern (sparklines)

## Technical Notes
- ~380 lines
- Generates 8 feed items from mock data
- Client-side filter state
- Scroll event listener for FAB visibility
- Each card has independent like/bookmark state
